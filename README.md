# Decision Tree Task

This Github Repo contains a Decision Tree task where I build a tree from scratch using random dataset that indiciates if a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on 3 features.

A **decision tree** is a machine learning model that mimics human decision-making. It's a flowchart-like structure where each internal node asks a question about the data,
 and the answer branches you to the next question or a final prediction. This process of splitting the data based on features helps classify or predict target values for new unseen data.

Ultimate aim of this task is to come up with a Decision Tree, that decides a best split based on information gain calculated at each node which is further calculated from entropy. The leaf nodes will tell us if the mushroom was edible or posionous.

I have completed these projects while completing my Coursera specialization called [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/NG3GPTVN7M8E?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=s12n)
